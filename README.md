# FilmPot

## What is The Film Pot
Film Pot allows Kyle and Rhiann to add films to their To Watch list, and give them a randomly selected film to watch so there are no arguments.

## Why make Film Pot
Film Pot was made as a digital replication of their Film Pot so they could continue to watch films from it during Lockdown 2: Electric Boogaloo.
